# HP - metric converter

### This module helps you convert HP to or from cm, or other metric measurments. 

HP is Short for *Horizontal Pitch*. In the Eurorack format for synthesizer modules, the width of a module is defined as the number of hp (horizontal pitch) units. Each hp is 0.2‚Äù (5.08 mm). Most modules are even numbers of hp wide, although some are odd numbers
